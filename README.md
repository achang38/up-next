A movie suggestion application that recommends movies to the user based on the movies and actors they've liked in the past. This application was created to be the final project for CS564 Database Management Systems at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

## Setup
Running this application requires the installation of Java and MySQL. First, run createtables.sql in the /code/SQLfiles folder. All the csv files are available in /datasets/cleaned_data and they must be moved to the proper folder when running the SQL commands. Then, compile and run Drawing.java.
